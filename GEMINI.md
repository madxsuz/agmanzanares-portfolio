# GEMINI.md

## Project Overview

This is a portfolio project for agmanzanares, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It is a standard setup with a `src` directory containing the main application logic, a `public` directory for static assets, and configuration files for Vite, TypeScript, and ESLint.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **Vite:** A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
*   **ESLint:** A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## Building and Running

### Development

To run the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and make the application available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile the TypeScript code and create a `dist` directory with the production-ready files.

### Linting

To run the linter and check for code quality, use the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Development Conventions

### Coding Style

The project uses ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style. The ESLint configuration is located in `eslint.config.js`. It is recommended to run the linter before committing any changes.

### Testing

There are no testing frameworks configured in this project yet. A placeholder for testing information is provided below.

**TODO:** Add information about the testing framework and how to run tests once they are configured.
