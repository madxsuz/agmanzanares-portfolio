# agmanzanares-portfolio

This is a personal portfolio project for agmanzanares, showcasing various skills and projects. It is built with a modern web development stack.

## Key Technologies

This project leverages the following technologies:

*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer experience.
*   **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides an efficient development experience for modern web projects.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling web applications.
*   **ESLint**: A pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX, ensuring consistent code quality and style.

## Building and Running

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/agmanzanares-portfolio.git
    cd agmanzanares-portfolio
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Vite development server and makes the application accessible locally, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Building for Production

To build the project for production deployment:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the TypeScript code and bundles all assets into a `dist` directory, ready for deployment.

### Linting

To check for code quality and style issues:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This command runs ESLint across the codebase.

### Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production-ready build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This serves the content from the `dist` directory, allowing you to see how the optimized production build will behave.
